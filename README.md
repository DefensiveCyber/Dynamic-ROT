## __ROT(i) DECODER__

I wrote this to deal with a CTF question that I had. I couldn't find one online that incremented this way. Kind of a "dynamic ROT".

This is a decoder for ROT(i). It works by taking the index of each letter in the message and decrementing the ROT by 1 to account for 
spaces and punctuation.

## Added Encoder as well
